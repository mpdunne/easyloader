## The basics

PyTorch DataLoaders and Datasets are wonderfully convenient tools for managing data when training machine learning models.

However they're not always fast! Torch DataLoaders load data one sample at a time and concatenate the result, which can be useful for distributed training tasks and for loading files from disk, but is generally inefficient. For heavy data sets data retrieval can end up taking a sizeable (and unnecessary) chunk of training time. 

**EasyLoader** provides a set of PyTorch data sets and ready to use data loader classes that efficiently load data orders of magnitude faster than PyTorch DataLoaders alone, removing hidden data bottlenecks from model training. They also contain a selection a few features to make data loading pain-free! 

## Usage

Three flavours of `EasyLoader` and `EasyDataset` class are provided.

### Arrays
`ArrayDataset` and `ArrayDataLoader` are for loading from NumPy arrays. The inputted `arrays` can either be a single array or a list of arrays of equal length. Like this:

```
from easyloader.dataset import ArrayDataset
from easyloader.loader import ArrayDataLoader

ds = DFDataset(df, arrays=[array_1, array_2])
values = ds[:10]

dl = DFDataLoader(df, arrays=array_1)
for batch in dl:
    print(batch)
```

### DataFrames
`DFDataset` and `DFDataLoader` are for loading from Pandas DataFrames. The inputted `columns` can be used to specify which columns to extract. Like this:

```
from easyloader.dataset import DFDataset
from easyloader.loader import DFDataLoader

ds = DFDataset(df, columns=[['column_1', 'column_2'], 'column_3'])
values = ds[:10]

dl = DFDataLoader(df, columns=['column_1', 'column_2'], batch_size=10)
for batch in dl:
    print(batch)
```

If `columns` is left blank, all columns are used.

### H5 files
`H5Dataset` and`H5DataLoader` for loading from an H5 File. The `keys` attribute can be used to specify one or more keys to load, like this:

```
from easyloader.dataset import H5Dataset
from easyloader.loader import H5DataLoader

ds = H5Dataset(h5_file, keys=['key_1', 'key_2'])
values = ds[:10]

dl = H5DataLoader(df, keys='key_1', batch_size=10)
for batch in dl:
    print(batch)
```

## Shuffling & sampling

Each `EasyDataset` can be shuffled and sampled directly, modifying the index of the underlying dataset. Separate seeds can be specified for each action, by specifying `sample_seed` and `shuffle_seed`

Datasets can be sampled using `ds.sample(sample_fraction=sample_fraction)`, or sampled on creation using the same argument.

Datasets can be shuffled using ds.shuffle(). In `DataLoaders`, if `shuffle=True` is set, then the data will be shuffled at the beginning of every loop of the data.

## Keeping track of IDs

It's often useful to keep track of the IDs of sequences used for predictions. For this purpose, both `EasyDataset` and `EasyDataLoader` classes have an `ids` attribute which is set at the point of initialisation.
- For `ArrayDataset`/`ArrayDataLoader`, this is inputted as a list of IDs
- For `DFDataset`/`DFDataLoader`, this also be specified as a column in the H5 file.
- For `H5Dataset`/`H5DataLoader`, this can be specified as a key in the H5 file.

In all cases, the numeric index will be used if this argument is left blank.

The IDs are accessed using `ds.ids` and will update whenever the data is shuffled or sampled. 


## Grains

For H5 files, data is most efficiently loaded when it is contiguous on the disk. When data is shuffled, the chances that any two samples that are adjacent in the batch are also adjacent on the disk is low. To solve this, we use *graining*. Rather then shuffling or sampling fully, we break the data into grains and shuffle/sample those grains [(see this blog post for more info)](https://towardsdatascience.com/reading-h5-files-faster-with-pytorch-datasets-3ff86938cc).

It massively increases the speed of H5 access, generally without affecting model performance. To use graining with any data set, just set the `grain_size` parameter to anything higher than `1`.
